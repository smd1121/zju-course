  5.1 ISE 

    The following are known issues for v7.3 of this core at time of release:
  
    1. Power estimation figures in the datasheet are preliminary for Virtex-5 and Spartan-3.
  
    3. Core does not generate for large memories. Depending on the
       machine the ISE CORE Generator software runs on, the maximum size of the memory that

       with 2 GB RAM can generate a memory core of size 1.8 MBits or 230 KBytes
      - CR 415768
      - AR 24034
