*     The Xilinx LogiCORE IP Block Memory Generator replaces the Dual Port     *
*     Block Memory and Single Port Block Memory LogiCOREs, but is not a        *
*     direct drop-in replacement.  It should be used in all new Xilinx         *
*     designs. The core supports RAM and ROM functions over a wide range of    *
*     widths and depths. Use this core to generate block memories with         *
*     symmetric or asymmetric read and write port widths, as well as cores     *
*     which can perform simultaneous write operations to separate              *
*     locations, and simultaneous read operations from the same location.      *
*     For more information on differences in interface and feature support     *
*     between this core and the Dual Port Block Memory and Single Port         *
*     Block Memory LogiCOREs, please consult the data sheet.                   *
